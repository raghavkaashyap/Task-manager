Python Task Manager!

This project is helpful to anybody who has many things to keep track of and do over the week. The goal of this program is to help users organize their work and manage their time better by giving them a clear vision of how their week is supposed to go. The user will input task details like the name of the task, duration (approximate time, in hours, it should take the user to complete the task), and the deadline for completing the task into the program and will receive a schedule (in tabular format) for the week. The schedule contains the duration and time for which a particular task can be done everyday of the week so as to finish it before the deadline. The user can submit as many tasks as they please. The program then emails the user a reminder to complete their tasks. 

LIMITATIONS: 
1) The deadline entered should preferably be within one week from the current date.
2) The source code for the program has only been tested on Python3, so make sure to use Python3 while running the program.
3) The source code has been extensively tested on Windows, but not on macOS or other platforms.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
1) Fonts used in the source code (lines 241 and 246) are native Windows fonts. The source code may be used on other platforms after downloading lucida_calligraphy_italic.ttf and BASKE1.ttf, commenting out lines 241 and 246, and uncommenting lines 242 and 247. Bear in mind that when these files are downloaded, the user must store the file path in a string and update lines 242 and 247 accordingly.
